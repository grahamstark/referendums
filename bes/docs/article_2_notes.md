scotReferendumRetroW3 *does* exist

Robin MaAlpine
===============

1) leave voters happy to leave (test???)

> "Our generations seem to make more and more assumptions about what is 'true', or perhaps it's just that social media means we are better able to hear people's assumptions about what is 'true'. It is something of a companion to 'fake news' – many of us make statements on complex issues in short phrases which strip out the complexity."

> "What this implies is that if we want to change our strategic tack then in fact we should be easing off on the pro-immigration rhetoric, being a bit more populist in bashing bankers etc. and probably being a bit more conservative in our narrative on 'identity politics'."

> "But here's the thing – I don't think that's what we should do at all, because the other thing that this polling analysis says to me is that of all the possible core pitches we could make for independence, the one we've been making about a better, fairer, kinder nation is probably the most coherent we have given the demographics we face and is most likely to appeal to the most people."

> Actually, you're much better off asking fewer questions about independence and many more questions about the respondent. It's being able to get into the detail of different demographics and how they are reacting that helps you to build a strategy.

> For example, how did women earning public sector salaries of between £25,000 and £45,000 vote? Or low income men over 50 in rural areas? This is the kind of information we just don't have, and its the kind of information a professional strategist would want most.

More BES Notes
=========

so 1) add 

urban/rural

   `glasgow = bes$profile_oslaua == 164`
   
Borders = B
Highlands = H
City=C
Urban=U
   

Did you say plan R??
====================

1. add urban/city/highlands dummies
2. buglist to owners BES
3. split 2nd article stuff to own script
4. think about simulation
